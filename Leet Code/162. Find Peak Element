/** 
* 162. Find Peak Element
* A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
* Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
* You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
* You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
